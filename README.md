C++ JSON Content Rules Parser

Testing
=====
The unit tests are in the `test` project of the main C++ solution.

The `execution-tests` directory contains material for testing the error
messages generated by the `jcrcheck` program.  The directory contains sample
JCR files and the `0-test-runner.rb` test program.   `0-test-runner.rb` globs
all the sample JCR files and runs the `jcrcheck` program on each of them,
capturing the output into separate files.  If a pre-vetted reference output is
present, it compares the generated output to the reference.  The results of
running `jcrcheck` on `<name>.jcr` is stored in the file `<name>.txt` and the
pre-vetted reference versions of the output are stored in files named
`<name>.zinc.txt`.  (The reference file names are augmented with `zinc`
rather than `gold` so that the order of display in Windows explorer is more
natural.)

Tests Table of Contents
======================
To assist in seeing how the library can be used, using the principle of
'tests as documentation', the [test Table of Contents is
here](test/clunit-toc.md).
