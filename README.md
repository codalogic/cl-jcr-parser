Testing
=====
The unit tests are in the `test` project of the main C++ solution.

The `execution-tests` directory contains material for testing the error
messages generated by the `jcrcheck` program.  The directory contains
the `test-runner.rb` test program, `zinc-reviewer.rb` and sub-directories
with sample JCR files.

`test-runner.rb` globs all the sample JCR files and runs the `jcrcheck`
program on each of them, capturing the output into separate files.  If a
pre-vetted reference output is present, it compares the generated output to
the reference.  The results of running `jcrcheck` on `<name>.jcr` is stored
in the file `<name>.txt` and the pre-vetted reference versions of the output
are stored in files named `<name>.zinc.txt`.  (The reference file names are
augmented with `zinc` rather than `gold` so that the order of display in
Windows explorer is more natural.)

`zinc-reviewer.rb` is a Ruby/Tk based program that facilitates reviewing the
results of tests run by `test-runner.rb` and selecting vetted zinc references.

Tests Table of Contents
======================
To assist in seeing how the library can be used, using the principle of
'tests as documentation', the [test Table of Contents is
