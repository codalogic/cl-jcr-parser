This directory and its sub-directories contain test material consisting of
JCR samples, and records of the results of running jcrcheck.exe on the samples.

The tests are run by test-runner.rb.

Tests are arranged in order of complexity.  Tests in directory names starting
with 1-* are the simplest, with higher numbered directories having harder
tests.
