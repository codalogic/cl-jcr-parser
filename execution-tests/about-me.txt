This directory and its sub-directories contain test material consisting of
JCR samples, and records of the results of running jcrcheck.exe on the samples.

The tests are run by test-runner.rb.

Tests are arranged in order of complexity.  Tests in directory names starting
with 1-* are the simplest, with higher numbered directories having harder
tests.

test-runner.rb takes the input JCR files, runs the jcrcheck program, and
compares the generated output messages against a 'zinc' standard (AKA 'gold'
standard).

zinc-reviewer.rb is a way of reviewing the outputs generated by test-runner.rb
and indicating whether they represent a passing or failing test.
(Note: sometimes zinc-runner.rb can take a while to load.)

See main project README.md for more information.
